# Welcome to the Daily Turing service
This service can be used to obtain in a machine-readable format the daily challenge for the board game Turing Machine. It will return both the criteria needed, (and in the future) the verifiers, as well as the solution.\
**NOTE**: Most browsers won't display the data, you need to curl or wget it instead.\
It runs daily at 03:00Â±00:05 UTC on a GitHub Runner.

## How to use it
